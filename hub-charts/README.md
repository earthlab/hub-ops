# Hub-charts

These are the helm charts for the hubs.

.. warning::
    We are no longer defining a helm chart for each hub. We know simply create
    a configuration file in `hub-configs` and apply that on top of the
    jupyterhub helm chart. Making changes in this directory will have no
    effect on deployment.
