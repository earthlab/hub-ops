==================
Get Started: Setup
==================

These are instructions for setting up completely from scratch and recreating
the setup that is assumed in all other parts of this documentation.

You should not need the instructions in this section very often. They are only
needed when you want to setup a new ``hub-ops`` setup or there was some
catastrophic accident with the existing Google project.

A good guide, maintained by the JupyterHub team on how to setup a single
JupyterHub from zero is: `<https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
Reading and following that guide once will help you understand more of this guide.
